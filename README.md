bitclock
========

Determine and predict symmetry in the display of the bit clock on Richard Kent Jordan's desk.

## 0.1
- Console script
- Print ascii clock of argument/current time
- Decide symmetry across a single hardcoded axis
    
## 0.2
- Expand symmetry matches to all offsets of a single axis (non-full matches)
- Print ascii clock with symmetry axis indicated
    
## 0.3
- Expand symmetry matches to all offsets of both axis
- More flexible input time format
- Predict next symmetry
- Print bitclock as image, color
    
## 0.4
- Expand symmetry matches to diagonal axis
- Serve script through web server
- UI for time input
    
## 1.0
- Realtime bitclock on webpage
- Sweet victory over arbitrary challenge
